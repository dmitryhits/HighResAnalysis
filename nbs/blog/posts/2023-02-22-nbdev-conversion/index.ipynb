    "HighResAnalysis package was developed for analysis of the data that a diamond sensor group at ETH IPA is using to study the data collected in 2018 and 2019 beam tests at CERN and DESY. The main focus of study was on two 3D diamond detectors. The package works and efficient, however, the documentation is sparse and the future developemnt and maintanance of the code is difficult. By converting the code to a notebook style will hopefully improve that."

The package was however based on the old version of the NbDev so I started by converting it to the new version. I hopefully will describe the details of that conversion on the projects [website](https://dmitryhits.github.io/lib2nbdev/)"
