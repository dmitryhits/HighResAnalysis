    "HighResAnalysis package was developed for analysis of the data that a diamond sensor group at ETH IPA is using to study the data collected in 2018 and 2019 beam tests at CERN and DESY. The main focus of study was on two 3D diamond detectors. The package works and efficient, however, the documentation is sparse and the future development and maintenance of the code is difficult. By converting the code to a notebook style will hopefully improve that."

    "Another issue, which required a lot of effort on my part, was unavailability of [ROOT](https://root.cern) package. The package is, however, available on `conda` and hence on `mamba` default channel. After spending some time learning about GitHub actions and `Yaml` from scratch. Luckily, the [documentation on GitHub action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is quite good and extensive. I found that there is an action available from [mamba-org](https://github.com/mamba-org/provision-with-micromamba) that allows one get a `micromamba` environment on the GitHub action virtual machine (VR). For the action to work I needed to provide it with `environemnt.yaml`, that is when I realized that none of my repository files are available on the VR by default but luckily there is a `checkout` action available from GitHub [actions](https://github.com/actions/). That allowed the `micromamba` setup to work and to install root, however, it still did not make it available for import in a python script, because the environment was not activated. Here I learned something about the differences in `bash` flavors. If one looks at a log output of a git action, one sees that the default process to execute a `bash` command is `bash -e {0}`, which is not a logging shell. So one needs to change the default to `bash -l {0}` in order to have the login shell available, which allows to activate mamba environment. After that I was able to do `python -c \"import ROOT\"` test. However, I was not finished yet. The `NbDev` actions [nbdev-ci](https://github.com/fastai/workflows/tree/master/nbdev-ci) and [quarto-ghp](https://github.com/fastai/workflows/tree/master/quarto-ghp) changed the processing shell to `bash` and the ROOT was not available any longer. To remedy this I simply copied the `NbDev` workflows into my explicitly and changed the shell back to `bash -l`. This finally, gave me the green mark on both actions and I was able to finally see the projects [website](https://dmitryhits.github.io/HighResAnalysis/) :-)"
