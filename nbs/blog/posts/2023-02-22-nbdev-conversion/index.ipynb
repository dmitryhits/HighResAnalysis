    "HighResAnalysis package was developed for analysis of the data that a diamond sensor group at ETH IPA is using to study the data collected in 2018 and 2019 beam tests at CERN and DESY. The main focus of study was on two 3D diamond detectors. The package works and efficient, however, the documentation is sparse and the future development and maintenance of the code is difficult. By converting the code to a notebook style will hopefully improve that."

I hopefully will describe the details of that conversion on the projects [website](https://dmitryhits.github.io/lib2nbdev/)"
